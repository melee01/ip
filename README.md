**Project Nanat** is an educational software project designed to guide users through the process of building a small software incrementally. It emphasizes the application of Java and Software Engineering (SE) techniques throughout the development process. The ultimate goal of this project is to build **Nanat**, a Personal Assistant Chatbot that helps users keep track of various tasks and events.

## Features

Nanat provides a set of functionalities to help users manage their tasks efficiently:

- **ToDo Management**: Keep track of your to-do list and manage tasks.
- **Event Tracking**: Keep track of upcoming events.
- **Deadline Management**: Set and manage deadlines for various tasks.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management to ensure smooth user experience.
- **Task Management**: Add, delete, and save tasks as needed.
- **Task Display**: View your task list and see tasks based on specific criteria.
- **Task Search**: Search for tasks containing specific keywords to quickly find relevant tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **Java SE**: The core programming language for the development of the project.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Using OOP principles to structure the software.
- **Error Handling**: Implementing appropriate error-handling mechanisms to prevent crashes and ensure stability.

## Features in Detail

1. **Add Task**: Users can add tasks to the system, providing details such as the task name, deadline, and priority.
2. **Delete Task**: Users can delete a task from their list when it is no longer needed.
3. **Show Task List**: Display a list of all tasks currently saved in the system.
4. **Find Tasks**: Search through the list of tasks for specific keywords to easily locate relevant tasks.
5. **Task Management**: Efficiently manage tasks with features like marking tasks as done, prioritizing them, and categorizing them.
